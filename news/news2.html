    <p>
        It's been a few weeks since the last update, and I'm excited to finally
        deploy version&nbsp;1.2! Special thanks to Felix, who encouraged me to
        add Spanish localization, which led to a refactor of almost every part
        of the app. That let me add the German localization, too.

    <p>
        I reached out to John Harper on Bsky and he gave me permission to add
        the Deep Cuts sheets, so they can also be found in this update.

    <h3>Deep Cuts Sheets</h3>
    <p>
        I've added Deep Cuts sheets to the app. Just toggle the sheet type in
        the Export step to see the Deep Cuts version of your sheet.

            >Note: Descriptions and ability names aren't adjusted, so the only
            thing that changes is the sheet itself.</em

    <h3>Fixes & Improvements</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Introducing
            <a href="https://lab.scoundry.com" target="_blank">Scoundry Lab</a>,
            the public staging area for experimental new features that you can
            try out before the next release.
        </li>
        <li>
            Added font support for the sheet painter with several fonts to pick
            from. Font choices are stored with the character data so it'll be
            persistent when you share your character.
        </li>
        <li>Selected ink colors are now stored with the character data.</li>
    </ul>
