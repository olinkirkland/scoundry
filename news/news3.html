    <p>Another Scoundry update is here!</p>
    <p>
        Special thanks to the French Blades community members who performed the
        hard work of translating the app's content to French, as well as
        providing me with the French sheets. In addition to the French
        localization, I've done a few fixes and made some quality-of-life
        changes.

    <h3>Fixes & Improvements</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Fix:</strong> Fixed attribution text for the Library of
            Congress on the homepage.
        </li>
        <li>
            The Vice text field in the Deep Cuts sheet now uses the correct text
            instead of the key.
        </li>
        <li>
            Fixed a bug in which nobody was getting tracked even if they allowed
            it from the popup modal. Everyone should get asked again now.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Custom Portraits</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>You can enter a URL to an image to use as a custom portrait.</li>
        <li>
            As long as the URL is accessible, the image will be as well. This
            means you can use images you've uploaded to Imgur, Google Drive, or
            any other image hosting service of your choice as long as it allows
            hotlinking.
        </li>
    </ul>
